		1. Overview of Linux
		2. Linux Architecture
		3. Linux Distributions
		4. Basic Linux Commands
		5. File Permission Management
		6. User Creation
		7. Shell Scripts
		8. SSH and VI Utility
	
	Lab: AWS Free Tier Account
	
		AWS Cloud Platform:
		
			- Create an AWS Account - Free Tier - 12 Months 

				- Active Email_ID 
				- Active Mobile Number 
				- Active Debit/Credit Card enabled with International Transactions 

			https://aws.amazon.com/console/
			
			
		Login to AWS Console ::::
			https://aws.amazon.com/console/
			- Login as a root user
				- email_id 				# Used during the registration
				- password 				# Created during the registration
				
				
		AWS Console is a Web Service to work with AWS Cloud Resources 
			https://aws.amazon.com/console/	
		
									
		Cloud Service Providers :					
			AWS/Azure/GCP/Digital Ocean/Oracle/IBM................		
			
			AWS Regions :
				==> Geo Location!			
				
			EC2 Service :
			
				==> Used to Create EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
				
				
			1. Create EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
					- Based on Linux OS Distribution
			
			2. Connect to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
			
			3. Login to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
					- Working with Linux Operating System
		

	1. Overview of Linux
		
		- Operating System : Is an interface between the User Applications and Underlying Hardware 
		
		Types of OS :
		
			- Windows 
			- Mac 
			- Linux 
			- Android
		
	2. Linux Features/Architecture :
		
	Linux Operating System 
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process 	


		- Command Line Interface 
	
		3. Linux Distributions	
		
			- Flavors of Linux OS 
			
				- Centos / RHEL 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 
				- Fedora									

			Package Management - Package Managers :::
				- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
			
					- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
					- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
					- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
													yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
					
				- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
					
					- Package Manager - apt/yum/dnf ==> can Be executed as a root user.
					
					- TO work with Package Manager :
						- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
							- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
								
	Learn Linux on DevOps Perspectives :
	
		What the Role of DevOps Team/Engineer on Linux.
		
			- All the DevOps Tools can be installed and Managed in Linux Machines 
		
		What is your role here ????
		
			- Install all the DevOps Tools 
			- Package Management - Periodically Upgrade/Uninstall - Backup of the Tools
			- Managing Remote Servers 
				- Client Server Architecture 
				- Server1 (VM)
					- Client1,2,3,4,5,6
					
			- As a DevOps Team we can Manage the Linux Machines
			
				- Package Management 
				- File Management 
				- User Management 
				- Access Management 
				- Remote Servers Management 
				- Process Automation(Shell Scripting)								
					
	Working with Linux :::

		- Package Management :::

			- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
		
				- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
				- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
												yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
												
			- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
			
				- TO work with Package Manager :
					- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
						- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
		
			- To Install any tool/package :
			
				Install Pre-requisites	
				Install Actual Tool
				Post Installation Actions				
		
					Eg.: Tomcat WAS :::: 
					
						Install Pre-requisites			===> jdk 
						
						Install Actual Tool				===> Installed Tomcat 
						
						Post Installation Actions		===> Started Tomcat 
		
	Working with Linux :::
				
		1. Create EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
				- Based on Linux OS Distribution
				
				- Login to AWS Console 
				- Go to EC2 Instance Dashboard 
				- Launch EC2 Instances.
				
					- Parameters to Launch AWS EC2 Instances :
						- Name/Tag
						- Choose Ubuntu v22.04 AMI 
						- t2.micro Instance Type 
						- Key-Pair 
						- No. Of Resource  = 1
				
Next :
		
		2. Connect to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
		
		3. Login to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
				- Working with Linux Operating System
