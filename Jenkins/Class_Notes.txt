	Jenkins Build Orchestration Tool ::::
	
	
	Continuous Integration : 			CI
	
	Continuous Delivery/Deployment :	Cd/CD
	
	
	Jenkins :::
	
	What is Jenkins :::
	
		Jenkins is Open-Source Build Orchestration Tool.
		Used to Automate the End-to-End Application Build and Deployments
		Using Jenkins we can create CI/CD Pipelines 
		
	Jenkins Architecture ::
	
		Jenkins is based on Master-Slave Architecture :::
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM)				==> To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Jobs/Projects & Schedule to run in Jenkins_SlaveNode
											==> Install Git, JDK, Jenkins
											==> Install Application Build Tools(Maven)
										
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)		==> Perform Application Builds - compile/create artifacts
											==> Install Application Build Tools
						
			
	Scenario1 :
	
		Client :
		
			Java Web Application Development
			
			Change Request : 1 or 2 CR per week / 
			
			- Less no. of Application Builds and Production release 
			

			Jenkins_Master (VM)				==> To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Jobs/Projects & Schedule to run in Jenkins_Master
											==> Install Git, JDK, Jenkins
											==> Install Application Build Tools(Maven)
											
											
	Scenario2 :
	
		Client :
		
			Java, .Net, python, Node-js, Angular, ruby, ......
			
			Frequency of Builds and Release are huge
			
			
			Jenkins_Master Np(VM)				==> To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Jobs/Projects & Schedule to run in Jenkins_SlaveNode
												==> Install Git, JDK, Jenkins											
											
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM1)		==> Java Build Tools					
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM1.1)		==> Java Build 						
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM2)		==> Python
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM3)		==> .Net
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM4)		==> Angular/Nodejs
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM5)		==> Ruby
				

			Target_Server(QA)
				
			Target_Server(UAT)

			Target_Server(PROD)

	CI/CD Workflow :::
	
		SCM_Checkout 
		Application Build 
		Unit Testing 
		Create Artifacts 
		Promote the Application to Test Environments
		Notify 
		Deploy to Prod 
		



	Working with Jenkins :::
	
	
		Developers' Perspective :
			- All Developers are just the Consumers of Jenkins Tools and Services.
			- Developers can just execute/cancel/view the Jenkins jobs/Status.		
		
		
		DevOps Perspective :	
	
			Roles & Responsibilies of DevOps Team :			
			
			Jenkins Administration 
				- Installation of Jenkins
				- Global System Configurations 
				- Plugins Management 
				- Tools Management 
				- User Management 					# To enable User Authentication
				- Security Management				# To enable User Authorization
				- Credential Management 
				- Master/Slave Node Configurations
				- Creation CICD Pipeline Projects 
				- Onboard Applications to use Jenkins CICD Projects  
				- Periodic Upgrade of Jenkins and its plugins 
				- Periodic Backup 
				- Troubleshooting the Issues!	
	
	
	- Installation of Jenkins :::
	
		--> Jenkins can be installed in Linux - Ubuntu Machine AMI - v22.04
				https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/
				
				https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
				
			Jenkins run as a service, it runs in default port 8080
			

	
	- Global System Configurations ::
	
		--> Define the default properties and external resource connections to Jenkins.
	
	
	- Plugins Management ::	
	
		--> Enable/Disable/Remove/Install/Upgrade Plugins!
	
	
	
Next :::
	
				- Tools Management 
				- User Management 					# To enable User Authentication
				- Security Management				# To enable User Authorization
				- Credential Management 
				- Master/Slave Node Configurations
				- Creation CICD Pipeline Projects

				- Tools Management 
				
				- User Management 					# To enable User Authentication
				- Security Management				# To enable User Authorization
				
				
				- Credential Management 			# To save the credentials used to access remote servers
													# Eg.: Build Servers, DockerHub, Github, Kubernetes Cluster Credentials
				
				
				- Creation Jenkins Projects on Jenkins Master
	
				- Master/Slave Node Configurations
				- Creation CICD Pipeline Projects 	
	
	
	- Creation Jenkins Projects on Jenkins Master ::::
	
		- Free Style Project 		
			- These are based on the Manual Configurations
			- This is just for internal tools/plugins validations 
			- Do not use this to onboard the applications.
			
			
			
		Handling Variables :::
		
			- Environment Variables ::
				- Pre-Defined Variables used by Jenkins.
				
					echo "jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}"
					
					Syntax: 
					
								To Print the value of any variable :
								
									- "${var1}"
					
			
			- User Defined Variables ::
				- To prameterize the Jenkins Projects!
				- Used to process run-time inputs
			
			
				var1 = "Hello"
				
		
			
		
		- Pipeline Project :
		
			- It is used to automate CI/CD Pipeline executions 
			- This can be created using groovy scripts
			- To Automate Application Builds and Deployments 
			- This CI/CD Workflow can be automated.
					CI/CD Workflow :::
					
						SCM_Checkout 
						Application Build 
						Unit Testing 
						Create Artifacts 
						Promote the Application to Test Environments
						Notify 
						Deploy to Prod
						
			
			Two Types of Pipeline Projects :
			
				- Scripted Pipelines 	
					- Based on typical groovy scripts
					
				
				- Declarative Pipelines 
					- This based on the parameters, auto-generate the groovy script to any task.
					- Snippet generator!
					- Declarative Pipelines are easy to create and maintain
			
						
		
	Alternative to Jenkins :
	
		gitlab-ci 
		azPipelines
		aws CodePipelines 
		bamboo 
		
		-> *.yaml / groovy / shell / python
